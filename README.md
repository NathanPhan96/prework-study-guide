# UCI BootCamp PreWork Study Guide Webpage 2022-2023

## Description

I created this PreWork Study Guide to help guide and expose relevant material to future individuals who wanted to enroll in a CS bootcamp. The PreWork Study Guide can serve as a stepping stone into the world of coding and provide a general idea of what an individual can expect to learn from a CS bootcamp.

## Usage

The Study Guide is broken down into four major sections: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each section will have notes corresponding to the relevant topic. If you do not know where to begin, you can open Chrome DevTools by pressing Command + Option + I for macOS or Control + Shift + I for Window users. This should open up a console panel either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. The console panel will display topics learnt from the prework and offer the user suggestions on what they should study first.
