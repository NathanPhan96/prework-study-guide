        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag. </li>
          <li>A tag only refers to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a web page and provide a framework for the user to navigate the webpage.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame.</li>
          <li>Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>CSS box model: every HTML element is essentially a box and each box has margins outside the element (element's borders, padding, and content).</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>

          <li>git branch: list your branches. a * will appear next to currently active branch</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certian task.</li>
          <li>A function is different from a loop/conditional statement because functions don't automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run.</li>
          <li>Since control flow dictates how JavaScript files are executed from top to bottom, order is very important.</li>
          <li>When you create a function, you are defining a block of code that performs a specific task and giving it a unique name.</li>
